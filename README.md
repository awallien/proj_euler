### NOTICE
For the Project Euler community, all algorithms written in the python files are encrypted.
You must request the password from me if you wish to see my solutions.

### GOAL
To be mathematically challenged and to learn more about the math side of computer science
in terms of theory (number, game, graph, and so on). 

My main objective is to solve each problem using algorithms with the "best" runtime complexity.
In other words, I want my algorithms to compute the answers to the problems in under 1 minute (or better, 5 seconds).
